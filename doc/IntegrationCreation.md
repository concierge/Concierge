## Integration Creation
Integrating a new chat platform into Concierge is a relatively simple process. It can be thought of as a special kind of module that provides I/O for Concierge.

Integrations can take two forms:
- A Native Script (see below).
- A Hubot Adapter. These can be installed as a directory within the `core/core_integrations` directory.

## Concierge Integration Format
Each integration must be in its own JavaScript file or directory located within the directory `core/core_integrations`. If a directory is used, it must contain a `package.json` file which has both the `name` (name of the integration) and `main` (entry point of the integration) properties within it. Stand-alone JavaScript files will derive their integration name from the name of the script file. No two integrations are allowed to have the same name.

### Methods
Each integration must provide the methods found in [Integration.md](./api/Integration.md).

## Handling Messages - API and Event
When messages are received by your integration they need to be passed to the callback method. This callback takes an `api` and an `event`.

### Event
The event is an object of the format found in [Event.md](./Event.md).  
The easiest way to generate this object is to use the globally defined object `shim` as can be seen in the following example:
```js
let event = shim.createEvent(thread_id, sender_id, sender_name, body);
```

### API
The API must provide all of the methods found in [Api.md](./api/Api.md). As it is not possible for every platform to provide every API, it is possible to use the globally provided `shim` object to simplify the process of creating this API as seen below. It is recommended you only create an API once per call of the `start method`. At the most basic level, the `sendMessage` method **must** be provided.

#### Appoach 1: ES6 Class Extension
Extend only the methods needed and create a new instance of the class. A `commandPrefix` must be passed during instantiation of the base class.
```js
class TestIntegration extends shim {
    sendMessage(message, thread) {
        // some implementation of sendMessage
    }
}
let api = new TestIntegration(exports.config.commandPrefix);
```

#### Approach 2: Object Definition
Create an object with only the methods needed. This will at runtime extend the IntegrationApi class as needed. The `commandPrefix` for your module should be provided within the object.
```js
let apiObject = {
    commandPrefix: exports.config.commandPrefix,
    sendMessage: function(message, thread) {
        // some implementation of sendMessage
    }
};
let api = shim.createIntegration(apiObject);
```
