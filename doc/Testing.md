## Tests

Tests can be run using one of the following grunt tasks.

Most grunt tasks will first launch a testing instance of Kassy, to perform acceptance testing against.

| `grunt wall` | Watches core and tests folders for changes and runs tests | Yes |
| `grunt wcore` | Watches core for changes and runs tests | Yes |
| `grunt wtest` | Watches tests for changes and runs tests | Yes |
