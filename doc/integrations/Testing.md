## Testing Mode

Testing mode requires no configuration. It provides a testing ground to experiment with your modules before using them live in one of the service integrations.

To start in testing mode, run `node main.js` or `node main.js test`.

Additional special commands exist in testing mode that are not in any other mode:

- `set senderName <userName>`
- `set senderId <senderId>`
- `set threadId <threadId>`
