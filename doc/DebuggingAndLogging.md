### Debugging CLI Options
There are two debugging related command line options that can be passed to Kassy. These must occur first and if both are used, be in the correct order for them to work.
- `debug`. Turns on verbose logging for Kassy. Useful for finding exact cause of an issue.
- `log`. Enables logging to a `kassy.log` file in the root of the project.
