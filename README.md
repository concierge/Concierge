(Karma + Sassy) * (Discord + Facebook + Messenger + Slack + Skype + Telegram) = Concierge


Concierge is a modular, easily extensible general purpose chat bot. It is platform agnostic and will work with any social network desired (provided an integration module). The bot utilises small node.js modules for responding in a chat.
You can write your own modules and place them in the [modules](https://github.com/concierge/Concierge/tree/master/modules) directory, or use existing modules we've collated [here](https://github.com/concierge/Concierge/wiki/KPM-Table). Existing modules include a variety of functionality from getting gifs,  to running arbitrary sandboxed JavaScript code, voting and giving karma.

Furthermore Concierge is compatible with [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) adapters and scripts.

## Getting Started

#### Pre-Requisites
Make sure you have **Node.JS** and **NPM** installed and added to your system PATH before installing Concierge. It is also *highly recommended* you do the same with **GIT**.
- [Install Node.JS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

#### Installation
Installation can either be done using `npm` (global or local) or `git` ([see which approach is right for you here](doc/UsageTypes.md)).

***NPM (global)***
```
npm install concierge-bot -g
```
***GIT***
```
git clone https://github.com/concierge/Concierge.git Concierge
cd Concierge
npm install
```
***NPM (local)***
For all documentation regarding local installs, refer to [Usage Types](doc/UsageTypes.md).

#### Starting Up
Concierge comes ready-to-run, so to start the bot:
- In the directory being used for Concierge development run the following command:
    - NPM global: `concierge`
    - git: `node main.js`
- On the first run, provided GIT is installed some default modules will be installed (see [here](doc/DefaultCommands.md) for details)
- After startup you will see the following prompt:

> Concierge-bot>

This is the default `Test` integration Concierge assumes if no other is specified during startup (more on this below).
- You can further test the bot's responses by calling a few of the default commands. Try entering `/ping` in the terminal and press enter.
- It should reply back with something like:

> Concierge-bot 4.0.0-beta.0 @ Raven (Linux x64)

If everything worked without any errors,

**Congratulations!**

Now let's go a step further and connect Concierge with an actual social network

#### Integrating with a social network
This simply requires installing the social network's `integration` in the `modules` directory.

[kpm](https://github.com/concierge/kpm) is a great module that makes this process a piece of cake. The process can be generalized into the following steps

- Run Concierge and ensure `kpm` was successfully loaded.
- Use `/kpm install <integration_name>` to install the integration where `<integration_name>` is the name of the social network integration.
- Use `/kpm config` with appropriate arguments *(account email, account password, etc.)* to set up the integration for connecting with the social network. Specific arguments and instructions on how to set them can be found in the integration's documentation.
- Use `/kpm start <integration_name>` to start the integration.

Why not try integrating Concierge with Facebook by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/concierge/facebook).

Links to configuring other integrations can be found in the documentation section below.

#### What Now
Now you can customize your Concierge by installing or creating your own modules.

- You can install an existing modules from the [KPM Modules List](https://github.com/concierge/Concierge/wiki/KPM-Table). Use the `/kpm` module *(which is installed by default)* to install using the KPM List.
- You can install any Concierge or Hubot modules from NPM.
- Or create your own modules by following the [ Module Creation](doc/ModuleCreation.md) guide.

**Hint**: Use `/help kpm` to find out how to install a module or have a look at the KPM List for a more elaborate instructions.
